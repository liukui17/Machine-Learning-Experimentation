This is a project used for the sole purpose of learning various machine learning algorithms and experimenting with them. By no means are these implementations well-optimized. The language is Java.

Currently, the experiments are being run on the MNIST handwritten digits dataset provided here: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/ (Thank you!)
