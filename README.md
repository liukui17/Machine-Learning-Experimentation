This is a project used for the sole purpose of learning various machine learning algorithms and experimenting with them. By no means are these implementations well-optimized or particularly well-designed. The language is Java.

Currently, the experiments are being run on the MNIST handwritten digits dataset provided here: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/ (Thank you!)

Knowledge is taken primarily from Mitchell's "Machine Learning" and the Coursera lectures taught by Professor Pedro Domingos. (Thank you!)
